# Essential Python for Machine Learning

This repository provides a curated collection of Python scripts and tutorials for essential concepts in machine learning. It covers foundational topics like data structures, functions, and control flow, as well as more advanced areas like data analysis, databases, and web frameworks commonly used in ML projects.

## Getting Started

This repository is intended for beginners and intermediate learners interested in getting started with Python for machine learning. It's recommended to follow the folders in a sequential order, starting with the basics and progressing towards more advanced subjects.

## Folder Structure

* **01-Python Basics:** Covers fundamental Python concepts like variables, data types, operators, and control flow statements.
* **02-Control Flow:** Dives deeper into conditional statements (if-else) and loops (for, while) for controlling program flow.
* **03-Data Structures:** Introduces essential data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets for organizing and manipulating data.
* **04-Functions:** Explains how to define and use functions to create reusable blocks of code.
* **05-Modules:** Demonstrates how to import and utilize external Python modules to extend functionality.
* **06-File Handling:** Shows how to read from and write to text files for data persistence.
* **07-Exception Handling:** Teaches how to handle errors and exceptions gracefully to prevent program crashes.
* **08-Class And Objects:** Introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts with classes and objects.
* **09-Advance Python Concepts** (**Placeholder**): This folder will be populated with tutorials on more advanced topics like decorators, generators, and metaprogramming.
* **10-Data Analysis With Python:** Explores libraries like NumPy and pandas for data analysis and manipulation.
* **11-Working With Databases:** Introduces concepts of databases and interaction with them using Python libraries.
* **12-Logging In Python:** Explains how to use logging libraries to record program execution information.
* **13-Flask/flask:** Provides an introduction to the Flask web framework for building web applications in Python.
* **14-Streamlit:** Covers Streamlit, a library for creating data apps in Python with minimal coding.
* **15-Memory Management:** Discusses memory management techniques in Python to optimize resource usage.
* **16-Multithreading and Multiprocessing:** Introduces concepts of threading and multiprocessing for parallel processing in Python.
